# Your Job Description
JOB_DESCRIPTION = """
Join the team building the automation platform redefining how real-world systems operate.

Base360.ai is an intelligent automation engine that connects data, orchestrates workflows, and powers large-scale operational systems.

We turn fragmented, manual processes into clean, automated pipelines that businesses can rely on globally.

We're looking for a Backend & Frontend Developer to help build the core platform — from API services and real-time automations to intuitive dashboards and control interfaces.

If you enjoy working across the stack, solving complex problems, and building products that run real operations, you'll feel at home here.

💡 What You'll Build

You will design and build the systems and interfaces that power Base360.ai:

Scalable backend services and APIs
Automation workflows and event-driven microservices
Clean, fast, and intuitive frontend tools for monitoring and control
Integrations with third-party platforms and data sources
Real-time dashboards and operational control panels

Your work will directly influence how teams automate, monitor, and scale mission-critical operations.

⚙️ Your Mission

Build Core Backend Services
Design APIs, data flows, and backend logic that form the foundation of Base360.ai.

Develop Frontend Interfaces
Create responsive dashboards and tools that make complex automation systems simple to manage.

Implement Automation Workflows
Build event-driven services, micro-automations, and intelligent logic that power real-time operations.

Integrate External Platforms
Connect Base360.ai with key partners like Stripe, Twilio, Airbnb, Hostaway, and internal systems.

Engineer for Scale & Reliability
Design solutions that are robust, observable, fault-tolerant, and built for high-throughput environments.

Collaborate Across Functions
Work closely with product, data, and operations to turn automation challenges into elegant, functional software.

🧠 You're a Great Fit If You Have

Experience with Node.js / TypeScript, Python (FastAPI), or similar backend frameworks
Strong understanding of React or another modern frontend library
Familiarity with AWS, serverless technologies, or cloud-native development
Knowledge of APIs, microservices, and event-driven architecture
A passion for automation, system design, and simplifying complexity
A builder mindset — pragmatic, fast, clean, and ownership-driven
Ability to work across backend + frontend and deliver production-ready solutions

🌍 Why You'll Love Working Here

High Ownership
You build real systems, not isolated features — and you shape the platform's architecture.

Real-World Impact
Your software will power automation for live operational environments at scale.

Fast-Moving Environment
Small team, no bureaucracy, and the ability to ship quickly.

Technical Creativity
Freedom to design, experiment, and build ambitious solutions.

Remote-First Culture
Work from anywhere — we care about outcomes, not hours.

🚫 This Role Is Not for You If

You prefer repetitive tasks over new challenges
You want rigid structure or slow processes
"Good enough" is good enough
You're not driven to improve and master your craft
